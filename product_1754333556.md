## 1. Start a Blog 

### Overview
- A blog is a regularly updated website with articles and content focused around a central topic or theme
- Bloggers can make money through display advertising, affiliate marketing, sponsored content, digital products, and more
- Blogs are very low cost to start but require consistent effort to produce content and build an audience

### Why It's Profitable
- Advertising revenue: Once your blog reaches 10,000+ monthly pageviews, you can serve display ads and earn a few hundred to thousands per month passively
- Affiliate income: Recommend relevant products or services and earn a commission on sales made through your unique affiliate links
- Digital products: Create and sell your own ebooks, courses, templates, etc to your audience
- Scalable: A blog is an asset you own and can grow into a significant income stream over time

### How to Get Started
1. Pick a niche you're knowledgeable and passionate about. It should be focused but with room to expand.
2. Choose a domain name and get web hosting. We recommend Bluehost for a low-cost, easy place to start.
3. Install WordPress and choose a simple theme to start.
4. Brainstorm topic ideas and use keyword research to find content that matches what your target audience is searching for. Aim to cover topics in-depth with quality, engaging writing.
