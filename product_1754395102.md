## 25 Easy Projects to Declutter and Organize Every Room in Your Home

### Introduction 
Do you feel like your home is cluttered, messy and disorganized? Having an organized living space can make a big difference in your daily life. It can save you time and frustration by making it easy to find what you need. A tidy home looks better and feels more welcoming and relaxing. It can even boost your mood and productivity.

The good news is, getting your home organized doesn't have to be overwhelming or expensive. This guide provides 25 simple do-it-yourself projects that will help you declutter and organize every area of your house, from the entryway to the bedroom. The projects use affordable materials and don't require any special skills. With a little time and effort, you can transform your living space into a neat, functional and stylish haven.

Whether you live in a house or an apartment, these projects will help you make the most of your space and keep clutter under control. You'll find solutions for cleverly storing items, maximizing storage in closets and cabinets, and creating designated spots for everything from shoes to spices. We've also included tips on sorting through your belongings and letting go of things you no longer need.  

By tackling these projects one at a time, you can gradually get your whole home organized. The results will be well worth it - you'll save time, reduce stress, and create a home that you love spending time in. Let's get started!

### Entry and Mudroom
The entryway is the first place you enter when you come home, so it's important to keep it tidy and welcoming. Here are some projects to maximize this high-traffic area:

1. **Wall-Mounted Coat Rack and Shelf**. Install a sturdy coat rack with hooks for jackets, bags, and dog leashes. Add a floating shelf above it to hold baskets for gloves, hats, and scarves. Label the baskets so items are easy to grab and put away.

2. **Shoe Organizer**. Shoes piling up on the floor make an entryway look messy. Keep them neat with a shoe cubby, hanging shoe rack, or a tray for wet or muddy shoes. Encourage family members to put shoes away as soon as they come in the door. 

3. **Landing Strip**. Designate a surface such as a console table or wall shelf as a "landing strip" for items you need to drop off or pick up as you come and go, such as mail, keys, sunglasses, or your purse. Add a small tray or dish for pocket items. Establishing a designated drop zone will keep these items corralled.

4. **Upgrade Your Hangers**. Switch out mismatched wire and plastic hangers for uniform wooden hangers. The slim design will maximize rod space, while the wood material prevents slippery clothes from falling off. 

5. **Hooks and Racks**. Take advantage of unused wall and door space by adding adhesive or screw-in hooks and racks. These allow you to hang umbrellas, keys, reusable shopping bags, the dog's leash - anything you need easy access to.

### Kitchen and Pantry 
The kitchen is the heart of many homes, but it can easily become cluttered with tools, gadgets, dishes, and food items. The key is to make sure everything has a designated place. Try these projects:

1. **Pantry Makeover**. Start by taking everything out of your pantry and tossing expired items. Sort foods into categories such as snacks, grains, canned goods, and baking supplies. Invest in clear, airtight containers and label them. This will keep food fresh and make it easy to see what you have.

2. **Spice Rack**. Organize your spices with a wall-mounted spice rack, a tiered shelf that fits in a cabinet, or a spice drawer with labeled inserts. Arrange spices alphabetically or by cuisine so you can quickly find what you need while cooking. 

3. **Maximize Cabinets**. Make the most of deep cabinets with pullout shelves, risers, or lazy Susans. This allows you to see and reach items in the back. For under-sink storage, use small plastic bins and label them for cleaning supplies, trash bags, and dishwasher pods. 

4. **Coffee Station**. Free up counter space by creating a dedicated coffee station in a cabinet or on a kitchen cart. Stock it with mugs, filters, beans, and stirrers for a grab-and-go caffeine fix. Add mug hooks underneath for a cute display.

5. **Fridge and Freezer Bins**. Organize your fridge and freezer with clear plastic bins designated for certain foods - deli meats, cheeses, yogurts, leftovers, etc. Label them with erasable markers so you can easily swap categories. The bins will keep foods neat, visible and accessible.

### Bedroom and Closet
An organized bedroom promotes relaxation and better sleep. And when your closet is tidy, you'll be able to find your favorite outfits and get dressed more efficiently. Here's how:

1. **Edit Your Wardrobe**. Start by weeding out clothes that no longer fit, are damaged, or that you haven't worn in over a year. Donate gently worn items. Organize clothes by category (pants, shirts, dresses) and then by color. This system makes it easy to find what you need.

2. **Drawer Dividers**. Use drawer dividers or small boxes to separate undergarments, socks, jewelry, and accessories. You can find expandable dividers or make your own using cardboard covered in pretty contact paper. Say goodbye to jumbled sock and underwear drawers!

3. **Maximize Vertical Space**. Make the most of vertical closet space by adding an extra tension rod for scarves, a hanging organizer for small accessories, and hooks or pegs for belts and long necklaces. Shelf dividers keep folded items tidy.

4. **Store Small Items in Baskets**. Use matching baskets to store seldom-used or off-season items on high closet shelves. Label them for easy retrieval. Decorative baskets are also perfect for corralling clutter on nightstands or dressers.

5. **File Fold Clothes**. Instead of stacking folded clothes on top of each other, try file folding them in drawers. This method involves folding items like a file folder so they sit upright in a row. It allows you to fit more and see every item at a glance.

### Bathroom and Linen Closet
Bathrooms can quickly become cluttered with toiletries, makeup, hair tools, and medicines, while linen closets tend to be catchalls for random items. Whip these spaces into shape with these tips:

1. **Tame Hair Tools**. Wrangle your hair dryer and other tools by installing a magazine rack or file sorter on the side of your vanity. This keeps them organized and away from wet countertops. You can also use a decorative jar or caddy to store brushes and combs.

2. **Organize Under the Sink**. Just like in the kitchen, use small plastic bins to group like items under the bathroom sink - cleaning supplies, extra shampoo, skincare, etc. Stack them on a tiered shelf or lazy Susan to maximize the vertical space. 

3. **Use the Back of the Door**. An over-the-door shoe organizer is perfect for storing styling tools, extra toiletries, washcloths, and more. Hang it inside your bathroom door or linen closet door. The pockets make great catchalls for random items.

4. **Linen Closet Makeover**. Declutter your linen closet by donating old towels and sheets. Sort and label remaining items - put sheet sets inside matching pillowcases and group towels by size and color. Use wire baskets or canvas bins to store toiletries, medicines, and cleaning supplies. 

5. **Display Pretty Products**. Don't hide all your bathroom supplies - display some of the prettier ones! Put cotton balls and Q-tips in vintage glass jars, use a cake stand to hold perfumes and lotions, or show off colorful soaps in a sleek tray.

### Laundry Room
According to a 2021 survey, the average American household does 6 loads of laundry per week. Keep this hardworking space tidy and efficient with these laundry room projects:

1. **Sort and Separate**. Use labeled laundry baskets or hampers to pre-sort whites, darks, and delicates. This saves time and minimizes laundry mistakes. Can't fit three big hampers? Try hanging mesh bags instead.

2. **Ironing Kit**. Put together a portable ironing kit with an iron, ironing board, starch, and lint roller. Store it in a caddy or basket so you can easily transport it to where you need it. This keeps all your ironing supplies corralled in one place.

3. **Decant Supplies**. Instead of bulky detergent bottles, use glass jars or canisters to store laundry pods, clothespins, dryer sheets, and stain removers. Label them clearly and display on open shelving for a clean look. Refill them as needed.

4. **Hang It Up**. Make use of empty wall space by installing a hanging rod, drying rack, or retractable clothesline for air-drying delicates. You can also add hooks for clothes that need a quick steam or that are waiting to be put away.  

5. **Keep a Junk Jar**. Keep a designated jar in the laundry room for collecting coins, buttons, and other small items found in pockets. When the jar is full, sort and put away the contents - deposit the coins in your piggy bank and sew the buttons back on!
