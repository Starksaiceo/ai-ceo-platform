## Understanding Midjourney Prompts

Midjourney generates images based on textual descriptions called prompts. A prompt provides a starting point and guides the AI image generation in a particular stylistic and contextual direction. 

Well-crafted prompts lead to incredible AI-generated art, while poorly worded ones often disappoint. It's critical to understand the key elements that make up an effective Midjourney prompt:

- Subject - The main focus of the image, such as an object, character, creature, scene, etc.  
- Medium - The artistic medium, style, or technique, like painting, sketch, 3D render, sculpture, etc.
- Artist/Style - Evoking the aesthetic of a particular artist, art style, movement, or genre 
- Modifiers - Descriptive details about lighting, colors, materials, details, background, etc.
- Post-processing - Specifying aspects like camera focus, lens type, photo effects, resolution, etc.

A great prompt balances these different elements, providing enough detail and stylistic direction without overconstraining the AI. The best prompts leave room for the AI to interpret creatively while honing in on your vision. 

Here's a sample Midjourney prompt broken down:

*/imagine prompt: A majestic mountain landscape, vibrant post-impressionist painting by Cézanne, golden hour lighting, intricate details, studio ghibli inspired, trend-ing on artstation*

- Subject: mountain landscape
- Medium: painting  
- Artist/Style: post-impressionist, Cézanne, studio ghibli
- Modifiers: majestic, vibrant, golden hour lighting, intricate details
- Post-processing: artstation trending

As you can see, this prompt paints a pretty clear picture, pun intended, of the desired output. By thoughtfully combining these elements, you can produce amazing AI-generated images with Midjourney. The rest of this handbook will dive deeper into prompt engineering techniques to help you master this craft.

## The Anatomy of an Effective Prompt

Now that we understand the key components of a Midjourney prompt, let's explore some best practices and strategies for combining them effectively.  Here are some tips for structuring great prompts:

### Lead with the Subject

Start your prompt with the main subject or focal point of the image. This instantly grounds the image generation and anchors the AI's "imagination" to a particular subject matter. Be as specific as possible, but avoid long, rambling descriptions. 

✅ Good: "A steam locomotive speeding down the tracks"
❌ Bad: "In this image, I'd like to see some kind of old-fashioned train, maybe one that's powered by steam"

### Specify the Medium

Indicate the desired artistic medium early in the prompt. This has a big influence on the visual style. Again, a short, clear medium works best.

✅ Good: "...impressionist painting..."
❌ Bad: "...in a hazy, indistinct style kind of like impressionism but not exactly..." 

### Evoke an Artist or Style

Name-dropping a famous artist or art style is a powerful way to steer the aesthetics. Midjourney can emulate almost any visual style. Experiment with different artistic inspirations.

"...in the style of Van Gogh..."
"...art nouveau poster..." 
"...Pixar-like 3D render..."

### Use Evocative Modifiers

Sprinkle in adjectives to shape the mood, colors, lighting, textures, and composition. Modifiers help refine the details and overall feel. But use them judiciously to avoid diluting your core idea. 

"...ethereal, glowing, bokeh..."
"...dramatic chiaroscuro..."
"...neon cyberpunk city..."

### Specify Post-Processing 

Indicate any desired post-processing effects, like a particular camera lens, depth of field, or color grading. These can help make your image look photographic or create a certain vibe.

"...80mm lens, shallow depth of field..."
"...lo-fi retro VHS..."
"...vibrant pop art comic book..."

### Combine Wisely 

The key to an effective prompt is thoughtfully combining these elements in a way that is clear, specific, and stylistically consistent. Avoid throwing in clashing styles or too many disparate ideas. The best prompts have a strong central theme.

✅ Good: "A majestic mountain landscape, vibrant post-impressionist painting by Cézanne, golden hour lighting, intricate details, studio ghibli inspired, trending on artstation"

❌ Bad: "A mountain or ocean landscape, either a painting or pencil sketch, inspired by Rembrandt or maybe Picasso, with dramatic lighting and also flat shading and cel-shading, 4K high-res"

Remember, crafting the perfect prompt is equal parts art and science. It requires a balance of clear intention and creative experimentation. The more you practice and iterate, the better you'll get at writing prompts that produce incredible results. 

## Finding Inspiration for Prompts

Sometimes the hardest part is knowing what to write prompts about in the first place. Staring at a blank page can stump even the most creative minds. So here are some tips and strategies for coming up with inspiring prompt ideas:

### Use Random Prompt Generators

There are tools like [Prompt Hunt](https://prompthunt.com/) that generate random prompt ideas. These can be great for sparking creativity when you're feeling stuck. Even if the exact prompts don't work for your needs, they can get the juices flowing.

### Riff on Famous Artworks

Take a classic work of art and imagine remixing it. Swap the style, setting, characters, or period. How would Van Gogh depict the Mona Lisa? What if American Gothic was cyberpunk? Remix famous works to generate novel prompt ideas.

### Real-World Inspiration 

Prompts don't need to be limited by your imagination. Look to the real world for interesting scenes and subjects. Imagine places you've visited or photos you've taken. Describe those evocative real-life moments as prompts. Ground your prompts in specificity and realism.

### Movies, Books & Media

Mine your favorite films, novels, video games, and media for inspiring visuals to turn into prompts. Imagine key scenes in a different medium, or describe iconic characters in a new style. Remix and mashup different media inspirations into crossover ideas.

### Iterate and Riff

Use Midjourney's powerful prompt-editing and re-roll features to iterate on your prompts. Try making small tweaks to wording and analyzing how it changes the output. Swap a different artist or style. Evolve your prompts over multiple iterations to refine your vision.

### Emotion and Vibe 

Think about the emotional qualities and vibe you want your image to evoke. Is it tranquil, mysterious, epic, quirky, dark? Tap into the feeling and atmosphere of your imagined image. Work backwards from the vibe you want to reverse-engineer your prompt.

### Wordplay and Juxtaposition 

Have fun playing with language, idioms, metaphors, and unexpected word combinations. Experiment with evocative turns of phrase. Try juxtaposing seemingly unrelated concepts. Wordplay can lead to surprising and delightful AI interpretations.

Use these strategies to brainstorm compelling prompt ideas. But also pay attention to what inspires you throughout daily life. Anything that captures your imagination, from a poetic turn of phrase to a striking real-world scene, can become fodder for an amazing Midjourney prompt. The more you flex your prompt brainstorming muscles, the easier it will become to tap into endless creative ideas on demand.

## Studying Midjourney Examples

One of the best ways to improve your prompt engineering skills is to study examples of great Midjourney images and try to reverse-engineer the prompts behind them. This will give you a feel for what types of prompts produce certain styles of images.

### Midjourney Community Showcase

The [official Midjourney Community Showcase](https://midjourney.com/showcase/) is a curated feed of exceptional images created by Midjourney users. Browse the showcases to find striking images to study.

When you see an image that impresses you, ask yourself:

- What do you think the prompt might have been?
- What artistic styles, mediums, or eras does it evoke? 
- How would you describe the subject matter and composition?
- What post-processing or effects seem to be used?
- What adjectives capture the overall mood or aesthetic?

Try to put yourself in the shoes of the original prompter. Break down the visual elements and brainstorm how you might reconstruct the prompt. You can even try to recreate similar images with your own prompts.

### Social Media Inspiration

Search Instagram and Twitter for popular Midjourney hashtags like #midjourney and #midjourneyai to discover more image examples in the wild. Many users post their Midjourney creations (and sometimes the full prompts) on social media.

Study how different artists approach prompt writing. Notice common patterns, phrases, and techniques that tend to produce good results. Whenever possible, compare the image to the original prompt to understand how certain words and phrases get interpreted.

### Prompt Sharing Websites

There are also dedicated websites where Midjourney users share their creations along with the prompts used to generate them. Browse sites like:

- [Prompt Base](https://promptbase.com/midjourney)
- [Krea](https://www.krea.ai/) 
- [OpenArt](https://openart.ai/discovery) 
- [Lexica](https://lexica.art/) 

These sites are treasure troves of inspiring Midjourney prompts and images to study and learn from. You can even collect your favorite prompts to remix and build upon later.

The key is to develop an eye for what makes a good Midjourney prompt by studying lots of examples. Analyze the images that resonate with you and try to pick apart the likely prompts behind them. Over time, you'll start to internalize the patterns of great prompts through exposure and observation.

## Midjourney Prompt Templates & Formulas

While every great prompt is uniquely crafted, there are some common templates and formulas you can follow to reliably produce certain types of images. Think of these as go-to mad lib-style prompt structures you can remix. Here are a few versatile Midjourney prompt templates to experiment with:

### The Full Spec

This kitchen sink formula combines multiple elements for an in-depth, highly-specified prompt:

*{subject}, {medium}, {artist} style, {modifiers}, {post-processing}*

Plug in your desired subject matter, medium, artistic inspiration, descriptive details, and photo effects to generate a prompt. Customize each variable to your needs.

 E.g. *A lonely astronaut traversing an alien landscape, vintage sci-fi comic book cover, Moebius style, vibrant retro-futuristic colors, dramatic lighting, detailed line-work, worn pulp magazine texture*  

### The Simple Twist

This minimal formula combines a subject with an unexpected style or medium for an interesting juxtaposition:

*{subject}, but {surprising medium/style}*

Think of unexpected or anachronistic combinations of subject and style for a creative twist.

E.g. *A 1950s suburban family, but ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic style*

### The Vibes

Conjure a scene or character by emphasizing its mood and emotional qualities:

*{subject}, {emotional adjectives} vibes, {colors/lighting}*

Brainstorm emotionally evocative descriptors and visual details to capture the overall feeling.

E.g. *A mystical fairy-tale cottage deep in the woods, enchanting and ethereal vibes, bioluminescent plants, fireflies, dreamy bokeh*

### The Metaphor

Bring a metaphor or figure of speech to life by describing it in literal visual details:

*Visual representation of {idiom or metaphor}*

Think of poetic or metaphorical descriptions and translate them into concrete imagery. 

E.g. *Visual representation of "drowning in sorrow", a figure submerged in a sea of their own tears, dramatic baroque painting*

### The Remix

Take a familiar character, creature, or object and re-imagine it in a novel setting or style:

*{well-known character/creature/object} in/as {unexpected setting/style}*  

Juxtapose a recognizable figure in an unlikely time period, place, or medium for a fun remix.

E.g. *Sherlock Holmes in a cyberpunk neo-Tokyo setting* or *Dinosaurs as giant Kaiju monsters attacking a city*

These prompt templates are just starting points. Customize each variable and mix-and-match different components to suit your creative vision. Use them for inspiration when you're feeling stuck, but don't be afraid to break the formulas and invent your own. The possibilities are boundless!
