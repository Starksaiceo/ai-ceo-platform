## Introduction
The world has rapidly shifted towards remote work. Whether you're a digital nomad living in Bali, a freelancer serving clients from your home office, or an employee working remotely for a company, productivity is key to your success. 

When you work remotely, you have incredible freedom and flexibility. But that autonomy also comes with unique challenges. Distractions abound, routines get disrupted, and it can be difficult to stay focused and productive without the structure of a traditional office. 

That's why we created this comprehensive Remote Work Productivity Toolkit. Inside, you'll find the very best tools, templates, strategies and hacks that we've discovered, tested and optimized over years of productive remote work. These are the exact techniques used by top-performing remote workers to consistently get more done in less time.

Whether you're brand new to remote work or a seasoned digital nomad, the 25 resources in this toolkit will help you upgrade your productivity and achieve your work goals faster than ever before. For less than you spend on coffee each week, you'll get a proven system for remote work success. Let's dive in.

## The Remote Work Productivity System
To achieve peak productivity working remotely, you need a proven system that keeps you focused, minimizes distractions, and ensures consistent progress on your most important work. In this section, we share the core pillars of our battle-tested Remote Work Productivity System.

### Time Blocking 101
Time blocking is a simple but powerful technique for managing your time and scheduling deep work. Instead of working reactively on whatever grabs your attention, you proactively block off chunks of time on your calendar to focus on specific tasks. Here's how it works:

1. At the beginning of each week, open your calendar and look at the week ahead
2. Identify your top goals and priorities for the week
3. Block off several 1-2 hour chunks of time for focused work on those priorities 
4. Treat those time blocks as sacred, non-negotiable appointments 
5. During blocked off times, eliminate all distractions and just focus on the work at hand

We've found that 1-2 hour blocks are the sweet spot for deep, focused work while still allowing flexibility in your schedule. But feel free to experiment with shorter "pomodoro" sessions or longer deep work blocks.

Start by scheduling 3-5 time blocks per week and gradually increase it until you have at least one 1-2 hour block of focused work time per day. Use time blocking consistently and watch your productivity soar.

*Bonus tip:* Schedule your time blocks during your personal "peak productivity" hours when you have the most energy and focus. Don't waste your best hours on shallow work!

### Productivity Toolkit Item #1: The Perfect Time Blocking Template
To make implementing this technique easy, we've included a pre-built Time Blocking Template. Just copy the template to your Google Calendar and start blocking off chunks of time for focused work on your key priorities. You'll be a time blocking pro in no time.

### The Distraction-Free Work Environment 
One of the biggest challenges (and opportunities) of remote work is that you have total control over your work environment. Without the constraints of a traditional office, it's up to you to consciously design a space that minimizes distractions and supports your productivity. Here are our top tips for creating a distraction-free workspace:

1. Invest in a dedicated workspace. Have a specific room, nook, or desk that is only used for work. This creates a "work zone" that puts you in a productive mindset. 
2. Clear the clutter. A tidy workspace helps keep a clear mind. Ruthlessly eliminate clutter and non-work items from your space. A few inspiring mementos are fine, but in general, opt for minimalism.
3. Upgrade your equipment. Make sure you have a high-quality chair, desk, computer and accessories that you enjoy using. The right equipment reduces friction and makes work a pleasure.
4. Manage digital distractions. Freedom and flexibility are great, but digital distractions can quickly derail your productivity. Use website blockers and turn off notifications during focused work sessions.
5. Enhance your environment. A few houseplants, an essential oil diffuser, and plenty of natural light will keep your space energizing and inspiring. Small tweaks go a long way.

Taking the time upfront to consciously design a productive work environment pays huge dividends. You'll be amazed how much more you get done in an optimized, distraction-free workspace. 

### Productivity Toolkit Item #2: Remote Workspace Checklist
To help you upgrade your remote work setup, we created a step-by-step Remote Workspace Checklist. It walks you through optimizing your physical space, digital tools, and productivity enhancements so you can build the ultimate distraction-free work environment.

### Communication & Collaboration Systems
Effective communication is essential for any kind of work, but it's even more important when working remotely. You can't just pop by a coworker's desk to ask a quick question or get feedback on an idea. That's why having reliable, efficient communication and collaboration systems is a core part of the Remote Work Productivity System.

Here are our top recommendations for remote collaboration tools:

1. **Slack:** Slack has quickly become the standard for real-time chat and collaboration among remote teams. Its channel-based structure helps keep conversations organized, while integrations with other tools streamline workflows. Don't forget to set a status and "do not disturb" hours to protect your focus time.

2. **Zoom:** For face-to-face communication, nothing beats Zoom. Its high-quality video and audio, screen sharing, and webinar features make it an incredibly versatile communication tool. We recommend scheduling a short daily huddle with your team to stay connected and aligned.

3. **Google Workspace:** The suite of collaboration tools formerly known as G Suite is perfect for remote teams. With shared documents, spreadsheets, file storage and more, Google Workspace makes asynchronous collaboration a breeze. It's our go-to for co-creating and iterating on work across time zones.

4. **Loom:** When you can't meet live, Loom's video messaging is the next best thing. Record your screen, webcam or both to create quick video updates, demos, feedbacks or instructions. It's a huge time-saver and adds a personal touch to asynchronous communication.

With the right communication toolkit, remote collaboration can be even more productive than in-person interactions. The key is consciously choosing a stack of tools that cover all your needs, from real-time chats to face-to-face meetings to asynchronous collaboration.

## Remote Productivity Tips & Hacks
In addition to core systems, we've collected dozens of tips and hacks from highly productive remote workers. Here are some of our favorites:

1. **Adopt a "manager's mindset":** When you work remotely, no one is looking over your shoulder to keep you accountable. That's why it's crucial to develop a "manager's mindset" and take full ownership of your work and productivity. Start each day by asking "what are the most important things for me to accomplish today?" and then ruthlessly prioritize those tasks. 

2. **Overcommunicate:** Adopt a practice of "overcommunicating" with clients, colleagues and stakeholders, especially about timelines, expectations and deliverables. Err on the side of more communication to ensure alignment and prevent misunderstandings.

3. **Protect your personal time:** Without the structure of office life, the lines between work and personal life can quickly blur. Protect your off hours by setting clear "work hours," communicating your availability to teammates, and fully disconnecting from work when you're done for the day. Your mental health and relationships will thank you.

4. **Build transition routines:** Working and living in the same space makes it hard to shift between work mode and home mode. Create a morning routine to transition into work, like exercising, meditating, or reviewing your goals over coffee. Similarly, have an evening routine that signals the end of work, like going for a walk or shutting down your laptop at a set time. These micro-routines provide structure and separation.

5. **Experiment with productivity techniques:** Try out popular productivity techniques like the Pomodoro Method, Getting Things Done, Don't Break the Chain, or Eat the Frog to see what works best for you. Treat your productivity like a game or experiment and track what makes you more efficient and effective. Everyone's different, so find the techniques that fit your working style.

## Building Habits & Consistency 
Here's the uncomfortable truth: Productivity "hacks" alone won't make you more productive. To achieve long-term productivity, you need to build consistent habits and routines that keep you focused and effective day after day. It's not sexy, but it works.

Here's a simple process for establishing rock-solid productivity habits as a remote worker:

1. **Set a SMART goal:** Get clear on your goal and make sure it's Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-Bound. Instead of a vague goal like "be more productive," set a clear target like "complete one focused time block before 10am every day." 

2. **Stack the habit:** To build a new habit, anchor it to a current habit. This is called "habit stacking." For example, if you already have a regular morning coffee routine, stack your new focused time block habit on top of it. Your new routine becomes: "After I pour my coffee, I will sit down and complete one focused time block."

3. **Track your progress:** Use a habit tracker to measure your consistency and see your progress over time. We like using a simple spreadsheet or the free app Habitica to gamify the habit building process. The more you track your habit, the more consistent you'll be.

4. **Remove potential obstacles:** Look ahead and anticipate any challenges that could derail your productivity habit. If you often get distracted by social media, remove it from your phone and use a website blocker. If you struggle to focus in a noisy environment, invest in noise-cancelling headphones. Be proactive about removing friction.

5. **Review and adjust:** No one builds a perfect habit on the first try. Each week, quickly review your progress and identify ways to make the habit easier or more effective. Treat it as an ongoing experiment and iteration. 

By following this process, you'll gradually establish productivity habits that become automatic and effortless. It takes some work upfront, but consistent habits pay huge dividends over time.

### Productivity Toolkit Item #4: Remote Work Habit Roadmap
Building new habits can be challenging, so we created a step-by-step roadmap for establishing key productivity habits like daily time blocking, weekly reviews, and focused deep work. 

The Remote Work Habit Roadmap includes:
- A habit building overview and walkthrough
- Examples of key productivity habits and routines

## The Weekly Review: Your Secret Productivity Weapon
We've covered a lot of productivity strategies and techniques, but if we had to recommend just one high-leverage habit, it would be the Weekly Review.

The Weekly Review is a 30-60 minute session at the end of each week where you review the past week, plan the week ahead, and get aligned on your tasks and priorities. It acts as a "productivity checkpoint" to keep you on track and adjust course as needed. 

Here's what to include in your Weekly Review:

1. **Review completed tasks:** Look back at your task list from last week and acknowledge everything you accomplished. Celebrate the wins!

2. **Process your inbox:** Go through your email and physical inbox, responding, delegating or deleting as needed until you reach inbox zero. 

3. **Review your goals:** Check in on your quarterly and yearly goals. Are you making steady progress? What do you need to prioritize next week to stay on track?

4. **Plan the week ahead:** Open your calendar and task list for next week. Are all your key priorities scheduled? Make any adjustments needed and get crystal clear on your game plan for the week.

5. **Set intentions:** Based on your review and planning, set 3-5 intentions or micro-goals for the coming week. These should be bite-sized priorities that you can reasonably accomplish in a week. Write them down.

That's it! The Weekly Review doesn't take long, but it makes a massive difference in your productivity and progress over time. It ensures you always know where you're going and catches problems while they're still small.

*Tip:* Schedule your Weekly Review for the same day and time every week to turn it into a consistent habit. Friday afternoons or Monday mornings tend to work well for most people.

### Productivity Toolkit Item #5 - Weekly Review Checklist
To make implementing the Weekly Review even easier, we've included a customizable Weekly Review Checklist. Use it to guide your weekly planning session and make sure you don't miss any key steps.
