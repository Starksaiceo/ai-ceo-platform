## Task Prioritization
One of the biggest remote work challenges is knowing what to focus on without the in-person cues and interactions of an office. This planner uses AI to intelligently prioritize your tasks based on due dates, estimated effort, dependencies, and goals:

1. Enter all tasks, projects, and commitments into the Task List
2. AI analyzes each task and scores them by priority
3. Focus on knocking out Quick Wins (high impact, low effort)
4. Tackle high priority tasks and projects next
5. Review priority scores regularly as new tasks come in

Tips:
- Be specific and comprehensive in listing tasks
- Set due dates for time-sensitive items
- Break large projects into smaller, manageable chunks
- Focus your energy on high impact work

## Communication Hub
Effective remote communication is essential but can easily become scattered across multiple tools leading to confusion and wasted time. Centralize all remote communication in this planner:

- Team Directory: org chart and ways to reach each person
- Chat Stream: quick informal chats (Slack integration)
- Group Discussions: organized by project or topic
- Meeting Notes: centralized notes and action items
- Visual Collaboration: virtual whiteboard space
- Announcements: important updates and milestones

Tips:
- Provide communication guidelines to your team
- Use the right channel for the message (chat, call, email)
- Record decisions, next steps in meeting notes
- Proactively share progress updates to keep team aligned
- Use visual collaboration for brainstorming, diagramming
