## Choosing Your AI Art Platform

The first step is selecting the AI image generation platform(s) you'll use to create your art. There are three leading AI art platforms to choose from:

1. DALL-E 2 (OpenAI)
2. Midjourney
3. Stable Diffusion 

Each has its own strengths, pricing model, and user community. Here's an overview to help you decide:

### DALL-E 2
- Developed by OpenAI, the pioneering AI company  
- Excels at photorealistic images and complex scenes
- Powerful inpainting and outpainting features for fine-tuning 
- Most expensive per-image cost, but very high quality
- Queue to sign up, not everyone accepted immediately
- Hosts images, easy to share and sell
- Strict content moderation 

### Midjourney
- Creates artistic, stylized, and surreal images
- Unique aesthetic, dream-like and illustrative 
- Beginner-friendly with simple Discord commands
- Affordable subscription plans
- Large, active Discord community
- More lenient content policy
- Basic web gallery but need to self-host images

### Stable Diffusion 
- Open-source model, free to use
- Run locally on your own computer/GPU
- Full control and ownership over the model 
- Technical setup required  
- Many forks and flavors to experiment with
- Supports animation and video generation

Ultimately, the best AI art platform depends on your needs and goals. Many successful AI artists use multiple platforms to expand their capabilities. I recommend starting with one, learning it well, then expanding to the others.

For beginners, Midjourney offers the best combination of ease of use, affordable pricing, and quality output. Its Discord interface makes getting started a breeze. You can be generating AI art within minutes of joining.

For maximum quality and photorealism, go with DALL-E 2. It produces the most impressive images but costs more per generation. 

If you want full ownership and control, try Stable Diffusion. It requires a more technical setup but gives you an open-source model to build on and complete ownership over your generations.

Whichever you choose, it's time to start creating. Let's learn how to write effective prompts to bring your AI art visions to life.

## Prompt Engineering 101

Prompt engineering is the most important skill for AI art generation. The quality of your text prompts ultimately determines the quality of the output. Great prompts produce amazing AI art. Poor prompts lead to disappointing results.

Here's a basic formula for effective AI art prompts:

[Subject] + [Medium] + [Style] + [Artist] + [Mood] + [Extra Details]

A few examples:

- A majestic mountain landscape, digital art, in the style of Albert Bierstadt, serene afternoon light, 4k resolution 
- A bustling Tokyo street scene, Blade Runner cyberpunk style, neon lights, intricate details, cinematic composition
- Portrait of a wise old wizard, in the style of a medieval woodcut print, mysterious atmosphere, highly detailed

The key is to be specific and detailed in your prompts. Use vivid adjectives and references to paint a clear picture of what you want. The more precise your prompt, the more likely you are to get the desired outcome.

Some tips for effective prompting:

- Use active, visual language 
- Include art styles and artists for reference
- Specify the mood and atmosphere
- Add details like camera angle, lighting, color palette
- Experiment with different phrasing and word choices
- Try adding "trending on Artstation" for better quality 

The real power of prompting comes from iterating and refining. Start with a basic prompt to get an initial image. Then use the variations and continue iterating and fine-tuning. With each edit and adjustment, you can hone in on your desired image.

Think of prompting like a feedback loop. You provide the initial concept, the AI generates an interpretation, then you refine your prompt based on the output. The more you practice this prompt/feedback loop, the better you'll get. Over time, you'll build an intuition for prompting and learn to collaborate with the AI.

Prompting is a skill that takes time to master, but it's the single most impactful thing you can do to improve your AI art. Practice writing clear, evocative prompts and watch the quality of your generations soar.

## Fine-Tuning with Inpainting and Outpainting

Even with great prompts, your initial AI art generations likely won't be perfect. That's where inpainting and outpainting come in. These powerful features allow you to refine specific parts of an image without re-generating the entire thing.

Inpainting lets you select a specific area of an image and modify just that part with a new prompt. It's perfect for tweaking small details, fixing artifacts, or replacing unwanted elements. 

For example, say you've generated a beautiful landscape but there's an odd-looking tree that doesn't quite fit. With inpainting, you can select just the tree and provide a prompt to replace it with a different tree that better matches the scene. Everything else stays the same.

Outpainting allows you to expand an image beyond its original borders. Also called uncropping, it lets you increase the canvas size and generate content to fill in the extra space.

This is incredibly useful for creating different aspect ratios and sizes from a single source image. You can generate a portrait image, then use outpainting to expand it into a landscape shot, a banner, a poster, and so on. It's also great for generating additional background or context around a subject.

Together, inpainting and outpainting give you fine-grained control over your final image. They let you art direct the AI and tweak every aspect to your liking. With skillful use of inpainting and outpainting, you can craft refined, polished images that look like they were created by human artists.

DALL-E has the most powerful inpainting and outpainting capabilities, with an intuitive interface. Stable Diffusion also offers strong support via its img2img mode. Midjourney currently only supports basic inpainting via image prompts.

To master inpainting and outpainting, practice the following techniques:

- Use detailed prompts to target specific areas for change
- Provide clear instructions for what to add or replace
- Experiment with different masking and selection techniques  
- Iterate in stages, making small changes and refinements
- Use image prompts and style transfer for better control
- Combine inpainted elements from multiple images into a composite

Like prompting, inpainting and outpainting have a learning curve. But once you get the hang of them, they become indispensable tools for crafting refined, professional-grade AI art. Master them and you'll be able to create anything you can imagine.

## Finding Your Artistic Style

As an AI artist, your unique style is what will make you stand out and attract collectors. But with endless possibilities, finding your artistic voice can be a challenge. Here are some strategies for developing your signature style:

### 1. Design a Prompt Framework
Create a reusable prompt framework that encapsulates your artistic style. This includes things like:
- Preferred art styles (e.g. art nouveau, surrealist, etc.)
- Color palette and lighting
- Camera angles and composition
- Recurring themes and motifs
- Mood and emotional tone

Your goal is to develop a mad-libs like prompt that reliably generates art in your distinct style. Then you can apply this formula to different subjects and ideas while maintaining a cohesive look.

### 2. Curate Your Influences 
Draw inspiration from your favorite artists, art movements, and visual styles. Put together a mood board of influences and references. This could include:
- Classic and contemporary artists
- Specific paintings, designs, and images
- Visual styles from films, games, anime, etc.  
- Photography and cinematography you admire

Look for common threads and aesthetics you're drawn to. Try to articulate what you like about each one. Then incorporate those elements into your own prompts and style.

### 3. Experiment with Prompt Techniques
There are many prompt techniques to try to discover your unique style:
- Use "in the style of" to evoke different aesthetics
- Combine multiple artists, styles, and mediums 
- Use evocative and unusual adjectives 
- Anthropomorphize inanimate objects and concepts
- Juxtapose unexpected elements to create surreal scenes
- Use symbolism and visual metaphor to convey ideas

Be creative and experimental with your prompting. You never know what might lead to a striking new style.

### 4. Develop Unique Visual Elements   
Design signature items and elements that recur in your AIart. These act as a unifying visual motif in your work. Some examples:
- Distinctive character specie or type (e.g. ancient robots, cyberpunk dragons)
- Stylized landscapes and environments (e.g. bioluminescent forests, floating cities)
- Custom color palettes and lighting (e.g. neon noir, pastel cyberpunk) 
- Trademark items/objects (e.g. futuristic weapons, alien artifacts)

Think about your favorite movies, shows, or games. They likely have iconic characters, environments, and props that are instantly recognizable. Try to create that for your own art.

### 5. Refine Through Projects 
Your style will emerge and evolve through the art you create. Put your prompt frameworks and techniques into practice with a series of art projects. Give yourself specific creative briefs and constraints. For example:
- A series of astronaut portraits in a retro-futurist style
- Surreal cityscapes blending nature and advanced technology 
- Stylized fantasy character designs with an art nouveau aesthetic

As you create these themed projects, look for what's working and what isn't. Which elements resonate with you and your audience? Refine and incorporate them into your future work.

Remember, style development is an ongoing process. Don't expect to find your perfect style immediately. It takes time and experimentation. Let it evolve naturally through your art. With practice, you'll be generating stunning AI art that is uniquely your own.

## Building Your Portfolio

With your newfound prompting skills and emerging style, it's time to assemble a strong portfolio of AI art. Your portfolio is your key to making sales, landing clients, and building your reputation as an AI artist.

A great AI art portfolio should:
- Showcase your unique style and vision
- Demonstrate versatility across subjects and genres
- Highlight your best and most impactful work  
- Present your art in a polished, professional way

To build a high-quality portfolio, focus on the following:

### 1. Number of Pieces
Aim for at least 10-20 strong portfolio pieces to start. This shows you have a consistent style and body of work. It also gives potential clients multiple options to choose from. Continue adding new work regularly to keep your portfolio fresh.

### 2. Variety and Versatility
Your portfolio should show range and diversity. Even if you have a distinct style, you want to showcase different:
- Subjects: people, places, objects, scenes, etc.
- Genres: portraits, landscapes, concept art, abstract, etc.
- Styles: different artistic styles, mediums, aesthetics 
- Moods: various emotional tones and vibes

Think about the kinds of projects and clients you want to attract. Make sure you have relevant samples that would appeal to them.

### 3. Image Quality and Presentation 
Curate your portfolio carefully and only include your absolute best work. Be ruthless in your selection. If an image isn't up to par, leave it out, even if you spent a lot of time on it. Quality beats quantity every time.

For each piece you include, make sure it is:
- High resolution and properly lit
- Free of glitches, artifacts, and obvious AI tells
- Cleanly edited and post-processed as needed

Presentatation matters too. Use mockups to show your art in context. For example, show your art as framed prints, on canvases, in magazines, on billboards, etc. This helps potential clients envision how they might use your work.

### 4. Cohesive Style and Branding
While showcasing variety, your portfolio should still feel like a cohesive body of work. Each piece should be recognizably yours, even across different styles and subjects. 

Develop a consistent look/feel to tie your work together. Use a similar color palette, lighting style, or visual motifs throughout your portfolio. Small touches like this make you work feel more professional and unified.

Consider your portfolio website's branding as well. Use a sleek, minimal web design that keeps the focus on your artwork. Avoid clutter and distractions. Choose fonts, colors, and layouts that complement your art style.

### 5. Unique Portfolio Projects
In addition to individual portfolio pieces, consider creating some unique projects to make your portfolio stand out:
- A themed series of related artworks
- Concept art for an original story idea   
- Fan art of popular characters or franchises
- An illustrated short story or comic
- Art inspired by a song, poem, or historical event  

Projects like these show off your creativity and make your portfolio more memorable. They give art directors a clear sense of how you might approach their projects.

Building a professional portfolio takes significant time and effort. Expect to create lots of art, much of which won't make the final cut. Refine your selections as you improve. Replace older, weaker pieces with newer, better work.

Remember, your portfolio is a living document. It should grow and evolve along with your skills. Continually update it with your best, most recent art. With a strong portfolio, you'll be well on your way to establishing yourself as a professional AI artist.
