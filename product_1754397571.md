Whether you're a busy executive, entrepreneur, or anyone who wants to spend less time in their inbox, these AI email strategies will save you hours every week. Let's dive in!

## Setting Up Your AI Email Assistant

Before you can start using AI to manage your email, you'll need to make sure you have the right setup. Follow these quick steps:

1. Make sure you're using a supported email provider, either Gmail (including Google Workspace) or Outlook.com (including Microsoft 365).

2. Enable smart compose and smart reply features:
- In Gmail, go to Settings > General > Smart Compose and make sure Writing Suggestions are set to "On".  
- In Outlook, smart compose and reply are enabled by default. You can manage them under Settings > View all Outlook settings > Mail > Compose and reply.

3. Install the free Boomerang extension for [Gmail](https://www.boomeranggmail.com/) or [Outlook](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/boomerang/9wzdncrdcn9g). This will enable advanced AI features like inbox pause, scheduled sending, and respondable.

That's it! With smart compose and Boomerang, you're ready to start using AI to power up your email game.

## Automate Your Email Writing with Templates

One of the biggest time-saving benefits of AI for email is smart compose and reply. These features use machine learning to understand your writing style and suggest personalized phrases as you type, letting you write emails faster.

To make the most of smart compose, build up a library of your own email templates that you can quickly customize and reuse. Think about the types of emails you find yourself writing over and over, such as:

- Scheduling a meeting
- Sending a project status update
- Requesting information from a colleague
- Following up on an unanswered email

For each type of repetitive email, save a template with blanks that you can fill in. For example, here's a meeting scheduling template:

```
Hi [Name],

I'd like to schedule a [length] meeting with you to discuss [topic]. 

Would any of the following times work for you?

[Date/Time 1]  
[Date/Time 2]
[Date/Time 3]

If not, please let me know a few times that would be convenient for you.

Looking forward to connecting!

[Your Name]
```

With templates like this ready to go, you can dash off common emails in a matter of seconds. Smart compose will learn these patterns and start offering personalized suggestions as you type.

In addition to your own custom templates, take advantage of pre-built templates from services like [Gmelius](https://gmelius.com/templates/gmail-templates), [Yesware](https://www.yesware.com/email-templates/) and [Reply.io](https://reply.io/email-templates/) to jumpstart your template library.

## Filter Out Noise and Focus on What's Important

One of the most overwhelming parts of managing a busy inbox is dealing with the sheer volume of incoming messages. AI can help by automatically filtering emails into focus categories, so you can zero in on high-priority messages.

Gmail's Priority Inbox feature automatically sorts your incoming email into these categories:

- Important and unread: Emails that Gmail's AI predicts are important based on factors like who sent it, keywords, and your history of interaction with that sender.

- Starred: Emails you've manually marked as important with a star. 

- Everything else: All other unread messages that aren't classified as important.

To enable Priority Inbox:

1. Go to Settings > Inbox > Inbox Type 
2. Select "Priority Inbox"
3. Click "Save Changes"

Now your inbox will show important and starred emails first, letting you focus on those before reviewing everything else.

In Outlook, you can use the Focused Inbox feature to achieve a similar prioritization. Focused Inbox intelligently separates "focused" emails you need to act on from "other" lower priority messages.

To turn on Focused Inbox in Outlook:

1. Go to Settings > View all Outlook settings 
2. Select Mail > Layout 
3. Under "Focused Inbox", toggle the switch to "On"
4. Click "Save"

Your inbox will now show two tabs, Focused and Other, with important emails under Focused.

To further eliminate distractions, use the Inbox Pause feature of Boomerang to temporarily stop new emails from appearing in your inbox. Just click the Pause button and all incoming messages will be held until you're ready to deal with them. This is a great way to carve out chunks of focused work time in your day.

## Prioritize Your To-Do's and Never Miss an Important Message 

In addition to filtering and categorizing emails, AI can help make sure you never miss an important action or due date mentioned in an email conversation.

With the Respondable feature of Boomerang, you can select any email message and have AI scan it for phrases that sound like a request or commitment. Boomerang will highlight these and let you create a task or schedule a reminder to follow up.

For example, if an email says "Could you please review the attached document and send me your feedback by Friday?" Respondable would flag this and prompt you to set a reminder to reply by Friday.

This is incredibly useful for making sure things don't slip through the cracks. No more kicking yourself because you forgot to follow up on an important email!

To use Respondable:

1. Open any email message
2. Click the Boomerang icon 
3. Click the "Respondable" button
4. Review any commitments or requests found in the email
5. Click "Schedule" to set a reminder

Another helpful Boomerang feature is the ability to schedule emails to send at a later time. This is handy for things like:

- Spacing out your replies so you don't look like you're constantly on email
- Hitting people's inboxes at a time they're likely to read and reply
- Sending things like meeting agendas the day before to give people time to prepare

To schedule an email:

1. Compose your email as usual
2. Click the "Send Later" button
3. Choose the date and time you want the email sent
4. Click "Confirm"

Your email will wait in the Outbox and automatically send at the scheduled time. You can edit or delete scheduled emails anytime before they send out.

## Turn Emails into Actions and Documents 

Oftentimes the information and files we need are buried in long email threads. AI can help turn unstructured email conversations into organized tasks, events and documents.

One of the best tools for this is Trove, a service that connects to your email account and uses AI to create structured records from email content. 

For example, let's say there's an email thread discussing a job candidate, with details like their resume, references, and interview notes scattered across multiple emails. Trove would consolidate all that information into a single candidate record that you could easily reference.

Trove works by scanning your email for things like:

- Contact information to create rich profiles of people and companies  
- Scheduled meetings, interviews, or appointments to create calendar events
- Attachments and links to collect related files 
- Project details, next steps and action items to create tasks

This is incredibly powerful for finding and organizing information that would otherwise be lost in your inbox. You can search Troves like a database to find exactly what you need without hunting through email.

To get started with Trove:

1. Go to [Trove.io](https://trove.io/) and sign up for an account
2. Connect your Gmail or Outlook account
3. Give Trove permission to access your email 
4. Wait while Trove indexes and organizes your email content
5. Browse your newly created Troves!

Trove offers a free plan that organizes up to 1,000 recent emails, with paid plans if you need more historical data processed.

## Automate Your Email Workflow

By combining all the AI email strategies we've covered - templates, filtering, scheduling, and organizing - you can put many parts of your email workflow on autopilot. 

For example, you could use Boomerang to automatically:

- Pause your inbox during focus times
- Schedule templated update emails to go out each morning 
- Remind you if you haven't received a response to an important email
- Notify you of any commitments or requests found in incoming emails

And with Trove, you can automatically:

- Create records of contacts and companies 
- Add tasks to your to-do list based on emails
- Collect important attachments and links in one place

The goal is to spend as little time as possible manually processing email, so you can focus on higher-impact activities. By leveraging the power of AI to automate the tedious parts of email, you'll free up significant time and mental energy every day.

## Conclusion

Email is an indispensable part of work and life, but it doesn't have to be a productivity killer. With the AI email strategies outlined in this guide, you can take back control of your inbox and free up hours every week.

The key is to proactively use AI to assist you, rather than just reacting to the constant stream of incoming messages. By automating email writing, filtering out noise, prioritizing important messages, and organizing information, you'll turn email into a powerful tool rather than a drain on your time and attention.
